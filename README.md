# Project-2-Part-2
* This code collects book information from the "Books to Scrape" website. It gets details like titles, prices, and ratings for a certain number of pages. It uses the requests library to get the HTML content. Then, it uses BeautifulSoup to read and pull out the data. Finally, it saves the results in a Pandas DataFrame. It then performs the data analysis: it computes the average price and rating of books, identifies the most expensive book, and makes a distribution of prices and ratings using Seaborn and Matplotlib. More precisely, key statistics and insights that come out of the analysis print and are also visualized by plots to give in-depth insight into trends in pricing and ratings in books.
